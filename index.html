      <p class="quote">"Great moments are born from great opportunity. And that's what you
         have here, tonight, boys. That's what you've earned here tonight. 
         One game. If we played 'em ten times, they might win nine. But not 
         this game. Not tonight. Tonight, we skate with them. Tonight, we 
         stay with them. And we shut them down because we can! Tonight, we 
         are the greatest hockey team in the world. You were born to be 
         hockey players. Every one of you. And you were meant to be here 
         tonight. This is your time. Their time is done. It's over. I'm sick
          and tired of hearing about what a great hockey team the Soviets 
          have. Screw 'em. This is your time. Now go out there and take it."</p>

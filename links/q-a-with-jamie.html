    <p>Danne asked how to reconcile what the Bible says about male leadership with an egalitarian approach</p>
    <p>Thanks for your comments and question. I actually held your position not too long ago and referred to myself as a "compligalitarian!" (a made-up word for sure!). The passage I couldn't reconcile in my mind and heart was 1 Tim. 3:1-7 as several things in that passage seem to argue for men overseers only. Below are the things I struggled with, and some thoughts that helped shift my stand on this important point.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem #1- </strong>v. 1- "if any man aspires to the office of an overseer..." (NASB95) </p>
    <p><strong>Answer #1- </strong>The word translated, man there is actually the broader word tis in Greek. Here are some definitions for that word and an explanation.</p>
    <p>~(tic, 5100), someone, a certain one,[1]</p>
    <p>"So, when Paul writes "anyone” in 3:1, he uses the Greek word tis, which is inclusive and gender-neutral. It would be misleading to use tis without qualification to describe a group limited to males. Furthermore, the preceding passage is about men and women. Paul had men and women in mind. If Paul had intended to teach that only men should be overseers, he would have said something like, “Any man who aspires to the office of overseer desires a noble task.” But Paul does not say “man.” Paul says “anyone” because Paul means “anyone”—man or woman.”[3]</p>
